# Lightweight IT Project Management System (Prototype)

## Overview
Simple web prototype to track tasks for academic teams. Built with Firebase Firestore for persistence and plain HTML/CSS/JS for UI.

## Files
- index.html - main page
- styles.css - styling
- app.js - firebase integration and UI logic

## Setup (quick)
1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Create Firestore database (in test mode for development).
3. Replace firebaseConfig values in app.js.
4. Serve files locally (e.g., `python -m http.server`) or host via Firebase Hosting.

## Notes
This is a minimal prototype for the MS project. Expand with authentication, milestones, risk logs, and reports as needed.
